# ELEC-3-Activities
A repository for my activity outputs for our Elective 3 Subject focusing in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The final project is a webpage for the College of Engineering of my institution.
This is PURE HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No Bootstrap, No Frameworks.
It is also mobile compatible.
